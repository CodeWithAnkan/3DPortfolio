# 🌐 Ankan's 3D Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my **3D Developer Portfolio**, a fully responsive and interactive website built using cutting-edge web technologies like **React**, **Three.js**, **GSAP**, and **Tailwind CSS**. This portfolio is a representation of my journey, skills, and projects as an aspiring **Full Stack Developer** with a deep passion for modern web development, animation, and interactive user interfaces.

> **Inspired by and built under the guidance of Adrian Hajdin**, CEO of the JavaScript Mastery YouTube channel — whose tutorials have been instrumental in shaping my understanding of advanced front-end development and 3D web experiences.

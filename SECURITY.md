# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is a personal portfolio project, and while it's not intended for production use by others, I still value good security practices.

If you discover any vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, unsafe links, malicious dependencies), please feel free to **open an issue** or contact me directly at [ankanportfolio@gmail.com].

I’ll do my best to review and patch any serious issues in a timely manner.

Thanks for helping keep the web safe! 🔐
